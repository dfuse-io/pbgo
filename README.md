dfuse Service Definitions Library for Go
----------------------------------------

This has generated code from the `service-definitions` repository for Go.

DO NOT import third-party dependencies in here (like the different chain's toolkits).

The `go.mod` within needs to be kept to an absolute minimum.

You can add helpers but only inasmuch they help using the PB
definitions, standard-library and thin thin general purpose helpers.
